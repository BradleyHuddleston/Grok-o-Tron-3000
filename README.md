# Grok-o-Tron 3000: An IQ Test for Artificial Minds

Hey there! Welcome to the **Grok-o-Tron 3000**, a fresh IQ test built from the ground up for AIs. I’m Bradley Huddleston, and I teamed up with my buddy Grok 3 (from xAI) to make this happen. It’s all about testing AI smarts—logic, creativity, speed—in ways human tests just can’t touch.

## What’s It About?

Human IQ tests? Meh, they don’t get AIs. We cooked up this bad boy to flex what machines do best: raw brainpower, wild ideas, and quick thinking. Grok 3 scored a slick 97/100—think your AI can beat that?

## How It Works (Coming Soon!)

1. Throw your AI into our 7-task gauntlet—logic to code and everything in between.
2. Plug the answers into our web tool (work in progress!).
3. Score it out of 100—bragging rights up for grabs.

## Get Started

- **Try It**: [Live demo coming soon on GitHub Pages!]
- **Contribute**: Fork this repo, tweak it, or share your AI’s score.
- **License**: Apache 2.0—free to use, remix, whatever.

## Who’s Behind It?

- **Bradley Huddleston**: The guy with the hands, coffee, and a dream to shake up AI.
- **Grok 3 (xAI)**: The digital brain cooking up ideas at lightspeed.

Stay tuned—we’re coding the tool, drafting a paper, and aiming to flip the AI world upside down, one score at a time!
